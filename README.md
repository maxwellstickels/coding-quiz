## Overview

This website functions as a multiple-choice quiz application, in which the user is challenged to complete 10 questions about HTML, CSS, Javascript in under 50 seconds.
Users can enter their initials into the Initials input box. Those who complete the challenge earn a score depending on the time remaining; the top 4 highscores are saved locally along with the given initials.

The application is started simply by hitting the Start Quiz button. From there, it is up to the user to click on the correct answers to the given questions. For each incorrect answer, 2 seconds of time are removed from the clock. If the timer hits 0, then the game is over.

## Programs Used
This website was designed with HTML 5, CSS 3.0, and Javascript (2020 Build) in Visual Studio Code 1.55.0.
